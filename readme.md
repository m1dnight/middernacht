# Middernacht 

Middernacht is torrent tracker written in Erlang. It is a pet project of mine to
understand the bitorrent protocol better. I would like to see this project
mature and will try to do so.

# Installation 

At the moment all you need is a working Erlang installation. To build the
project execute `make all` which will build the source. To execute issue
`./middernacht run 4702` to start a tracker listening on port `4702`.

# TODO

 - Introduce peer database
 - Make http part more stable
 - Clean up code w.r.t good style and convention
 - Use reltools
 - Invent time-making-machine to make more time
